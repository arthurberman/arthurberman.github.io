    <p class="c7"><span class="c22">Preparing for a one-day EP </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c0">On March 1st 2025, I&#39;ll be welcoming a group of musician friends to my home
            studio to write and record an album (or at least an EP) from scratch. I&#39;ve explored a few options for
            how to format the day&#39;s work. </span></p>
    <p class="c17"><span class="c10">Goals: </span></p>
    <p class="c26"><span class="c0">Release an album on the day it was written and recorded. Perform at least one track
            from the album live. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pay attention to production and quality. </span></p>
    <p class="c20"><span class="c10">Possible Approaches </span></p>
    <p class="c29"><span class="c0">Individual songwriting: taking 30 minutes to write songs individually or in small
            groups seemed like a good option at first. I&#39;ve seen it work before: 30 minutes is a limited amount of
            time, and an expectation of a complete, performable song constructed in that time tends to produce
            surprising and impressive results. </span></p>
    <p class="c28"><span class="c0">Pros: </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c30"><span class="c0">everybody writes a song </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c31"><span class="c0">we have a good well of performable songs which aren&#39;t too </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c27"><span class="c0">complicated </span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c0">Cons: </span></p>
    <p class="c23"><span class="c0">teaching the songs to other bandmates is a pain &bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c11"><span class="c0">individual ownership of songs might lead to hurt feelings. &bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c24"><span class="c0">Group songwriting: quickly generate A and B sections one after the next, then stitch
            them into songs. </span></p>
    <p class="c28"><span class="c0">Pros: </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">lots of options which everybody can immediately connect </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c15"><span class="c0">with </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">stems, loops, and even whole sections can come together </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c19"><span class="c0">really fast </span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c0">Cons: </span></p>
    <p class="c18"><span class="c0">genericization </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c21"><span class="c0">inflexibility </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">no opportunity for lyrics </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">Overture: freely improvise, and harvest favorite themes Pros: </span></p>
    <p class="c13"><span class="c0">continuity of artistic vision </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull; </span></p>
    <p class="c14"><span class="c0">Cons: </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0">improvisation in the moment + remembering for later is an </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&bull;</span></p>
    <p class="c16"><span class="c0">intense congnitive load </span></p>
    <p class="c25"><span class="c0">So, the format for the day is to simply play some group improvisation games of my
            own design, then write some songs based on the experience! </span></p>
