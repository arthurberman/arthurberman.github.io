        <h1>Teaching</h1>

        <p>I love teaching! After years of TA work at the Tufts University Computer Science department, I continued
            in the classroom with Citizen Schools apprenticeships, summer courses with Newton Community Education,
            and private tutoring in guitar and STEAM skills.</p>
